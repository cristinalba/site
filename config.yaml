      I am a software developer driven by a deep passion for web development. With a solid background in computer science and mathematics, I possess a strong interest in exploring the fascinating intersection of technology and design.
      Currently based in London, UK, I am fortunate to work as a software developer at [wine-searcher.com](https://www.wine-searcher.com), where I constantly push the boundaries of what is possible. 

      I am currently leading the group that automatize data scraping from websites to feed our internal database. My current project involves developing a web scraping solution to extract valuable data from various websites, enriching our internal database with valuable data.
